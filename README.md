## There are three types of Design Patterns:

1. Creational Design Pattern


2. Structural Design Pattern
3. Behavoural Design Pattern


## Creational Design Pattern: 

### Singleton: Ensure that only one instance of a class is created and Provide a global access point to the object.
### Factory:   Creates objects without exposing the instatiation logic the client and refers to the newly created object through a common interface.
### Factory Method: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
