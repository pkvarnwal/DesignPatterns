## There are three types of Design Patterns:

1. Creational Design Pattern
2. Structural Design Pattern
3. Behavior Design Pattern


## Creational Design Pattern: 

### Singleton: Ensure that only one instance of a class is created and Provide a global access point to the object.
### Factory:   Factory design pattern is used when we have a super class with multiple sub-class and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class.
### Factory Method: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
